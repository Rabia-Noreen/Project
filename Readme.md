### **Output Analysis**

1. **Program Start**:
   ```
   Welcome to the Student Performance Tracker!
   Follow the prompts to add students and their scores.
   ```
   - The program welcomes the user and provides instructions on how to input student data. It clarifies that you can add multiple students or type `done` to stop entering data.

2. **Data Entry for the First Student**:
   ```
   Enter the student's name (or type 'done' to finish): Rabia
   Enter score for subject 1: 80
   Enter score for subject 2: 75
   Enter score for subject 3: 82
   ```
   - The user enters the student's name as `Rabia` and then provides scores for three subjects:
     - **Subject 1**: 80
     - **Subject 2**: 75
     - **Subject 3**: 82

   - These scores are stored in the system for processing.

3. **Success Message (Unexpected)**:
   ```
   Student 'Rabia' added successfully.
   ```
   - This message is incorrect because the name entered was `Rabia`, but the program is outputting `Rabia`. 
   - **Possible Cause**:
     - There might be a bug in the code where the student name is either hardcoded as `Rabia` or incorrectly referenced. 
   - **Action Required**:
     - Fix the logic to correctly use the user-entered name (`Rabia`) in the success message.

4. **End of Data Entry**:
   ```
   Enter the student's name (or type 'done' to finish): done
   ```
   - The user types `done`, indicating that they have finished entering student data.

5. **Processing and Output**:
   ```
   Data entry complete.

   Student Performance:
   ----------------------------------------
   Name: Rabia
     Average Score: 79.00
     Status: Passing
   ----------------------------------------

   Class Average Score: 79.00
   ```
   - **Data Entry Complete**: Confirms that all inputs have been recorded.
   - **Performance Display**:
     - **Name**: Displays `Rabia`, which should have been `Rabia`.
     - **Average Score**:
       - Calculated as: 
         \[
         \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Score 1} + \text{Score 2} + \text{Score 3}}{3}
         \]
         \[
         \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 75 + 82}{3} = 79.00
         \]
     - **Status**: 
       - The program checks if all scores are above the passing threshold (40). Since all scores meet this criterion, the status is marked as "Passing."
   - **Class Average**:
     - Since there is only one student, the class average is the same as the student's average: **79.00**.

---

### **Corrections Required**
1. **Fix Name Mismatch**:
   - Ensure the name displayed in the success message and performance section matches the user input.

2. **Re-Test with Multiple Students**:
   - Enter data for multiple students to confirm that the class average and individual performance are calculated and displayed correctly.

# Student Performance Tracker

## Overview

The **Student Performance Tracker** is a Python-based project designed to assist teachers in tracking student scores, calculating averages, and determining passing or failing status for each student. The system is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Features

1. Add student names and their scores for three subjects.
2. Calculate each student's average score.
3. Determine whether students are passing based on a minimum score.
4. Calculate the class average score.
5. Display all student performances in a clean format.

---

## Project Design and Implementation

### 1. **Problem Understanding**
The goal was to create a tool for tracking student performance. Key actions include:
- Allowing teachers to input student data.
- Automatically calculating averages and statuses.
- Handling multiple students and summarizing class performance.

I broke the problem into smaller parts, which led to the design of two classes: `Student` and `PerformanceTracker`.

---

### 2. **Classes and Methods**
#### **Student Class**
- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: Stores the student's name.
  - `scores`: Stores the list of subject scores.
- **Methods**:
  - `calculate_average`: Calculates and returns the student's average score.
  - `is_passing`: Checks if the student is passing all subjects based on a minimum score (default: 40).

#### **PerformanceTracker Class**
- **Attributes**:
  - `students`: A dictionary mapping student names to their `Student` objects.
- **Methods**:
  - `add_student`: Adds a new student and their scores to the tracker.
  - `calculate_class_average`: Calculates the average score for all students.
  - `display_student_performance`: Prints each student's name, average score, and pass/fail status.

---

### 3. **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Create the `Student` Class**
I began by creating the `Student` class to manage individual student data. This included:
- Initializing student attributes (name and scores).
- Writing methods for calculating averages and determining pass/fail status.

#### **Step 2: Create the `PerformanceTracker` Class**
Next, I developed the `PerformanceTracker` class to handle multiple students:
- Added methods to store student data and calculate the class average.
- Designed a method to display all student performances.

#### **Step 3: Input Handling**
To ensure user-friendliness:
- Used a loop to repeatedly ask the teacher for student data.
- Implemented a `try-except` block to catch invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric scores).

#### **Step 4: Output Display**
Once the data entry was complete:
- Displayed each student's performance, including average score and pass/fail status.
- Calculated and displayed the overall class average.

---

### 4. **Key Challenges**
1. **Handling Invalid Input**: 
   I used `try-except` blocks to ensure the program doesn’t crash when invalid data is entered. Instead, it prompts the user to try again.
   
2. **Calculating Averages Efficiently**: 
   I used the built-in `sum` and `len` functions to streamline average calculations.

3. **Dynamic Student Management**:
   The `students` dictionary allows easy access and management of multiple student records.

## Running the Program

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

### Steps to Run
1. Save the Python file as `student-performance-tracker.py`.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd path_to_project
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python student-performance-tracker.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to input student data.

## Sample Output
### Example Input:
```
Enter the student's name (or type 'done' to finish): Alice
Enter score for subject 1: 85
Enter score for subject 2: 90
Enter score for subject 3: 78
Enter the student's name (or type 'done' to finish): Bob
Enter score for subject 1: 60
Enter score for subject 2: 55
Enter score for subject 3: 70
Enter the student's name (or type 'done' to finish): done
```
